# Analysis of Environmental Impact of Nuclear Power Plant

## Overview
This project analyzes NetCDF data using Python, specifically with the `xarray` library. The analysis focuses on understanding the impact of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The notebook includes data extraction, visualization, and analysis techniques.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas xarray matplotlib netCDF4
```

## Usage
1. Open the `NPPimpact.ipynb` notebook.
2. Ensure the required NetCDF file is available(provided).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load, process, and visualize the data.

## Notes
- The `xarray` library is used to handle NetCDF files.
- If you prefer `netCDF4`, uncomment the relevant lines in the code.

## Output
- The notebook generates visualizations for NPP impact.
- Key insights are derived from NetCDF data using Python-based data analysis techniques.
